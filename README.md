# connectfour
Simulates a "Connect Four" game. The game is driven by a driver program written in Racket. The driver program can take two programs that play a game of "Connect Four" against each other.

The C# program uses a heuristic function that ranks each branch (up to a certain number of levels down, the search depth value) of the game three to choose the best column to move.
